## Author:

## Repository
This repository is an individual assignment for the University of British Columbia course STAT 545B. The purpose of this assignment is to create a shiny package in R that is user-friendly and has efficient code, and deploy it online to *shinyapps.io*. 

## Penguins Shiny App Description
This shiny app is utilizing the dataset *penguins* from the *palmerpenguins* package. The user can view the data in an interactive table where you can search for entries, and in a histogram graphing the distribution of body weights of the penguins. There is an interactive filtering of the data for the body weight range and for the species, and you can select to view a single species or multiple species at a time.
